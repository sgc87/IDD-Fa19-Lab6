# ChatBot

*A lab report by Samuel Choi*

## In this Report

To submit your lab, fork [this repository](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/IDD-Fa18-Lab6). You'll need to upload any code you change into your fork, as well as upload a video of a friend or classmate using your chatbot.

## Make the ChatBot your own

**Describe what changes you made to the baseline chatbot here. Don't forget to push your modified code to this repository.**

[My code for the lab](https://github.com/sgc87/IDD-Fa19-Lab6/blob/master/chatServer.js)

For this, I created a ChatBot that listens to what you are looking for in a car and gives suggestions based on what your input. This will give users insightful tips on what kind of car they should consider. This is a good imitation for an actual bot. 

## Record someone trying out your ChatBot

**Using a phone or other video device, record someone trying out your ChatBot. Upload that video to this repository and link to it here!**
